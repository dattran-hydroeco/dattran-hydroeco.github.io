#### Hello, this is Dat. Currently, I work as an economist in the Florida Legislature, Office of Economic and Demographic Research (EDR). 
#### Before joining EDR, I was a post-doc at University of California, Riverside (2020-2021), University of Arkansas, Fayetteville (2018-2020), and North Carolina A&T State University (2017).

#### **My research interests** can be broken down into four main categories: *technology adoption*, *resource management policies*, *interactions between hydro-biophysical and economic system*, and *economic behavior under common pool resource systems*. I use theoretical, empirical, and numerical approaches to study these topics. Although, I have to admit that with the availability of large geo-referenced datasets, I increasingly spend time on machine learning, data analytic applications together with reduced form econometric analysis. Being an engineer by training, I am also involved in several interdisciplinary papers. Specifically, I collaborate extensively with civil engineers and hydrologists.
