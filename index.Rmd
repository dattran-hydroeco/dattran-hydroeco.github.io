I am an **interdisciplinary scholar** currently serving as a Research Scientist at the Florida Legislature, Office of Economic and Demographic Research (EDR), where I conduct policy-relevant analysis on water resources and environmental sustainability. I previously held postdoctoral research appointments at the University of California, Riverside, the University of Arkansas, Fayetteville, and North Carolina A&T State University.

**My research** lies at the **intersection of hydrology, economics, and environmental science, with a focus on coupled human–water systems**. I study how human decision-making and policy incentives interact with hydrologic and biophysical processes, particularly under water scarcity. My work integrates process-based hydrologic modeling with economic optimization and empirical analysis to inform sustainable water resource management.

My research interests include groundwater and water resource management, technology adoption, and hydro-biophysical–economic system interactions, with applications to agriculture and the Food–Water–Energy Nexus, With the increasing availability of large geo-referenced datasets, I also apply machine learning and data analytics alongside process-based and statistical models to support research on the Food–Water–Energy Nexus.

**I am deeply committed to teaching and mentoring and to educating the next generation of environmental scientists and water resources professionals**. In my teaching, I emphasize hands-on learning, modeling-based problem solving, and applied water management challenges.

Trained as an engineer, I collaborate closely with hydrologists, civil and environmental engineers, and economists and am particularly interested in interdisciplinary research that advances applied land and water management.
