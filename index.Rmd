Hello, this is Dat. Currently, I work as an economist in the Florida Legislature, Office of Economic and Demographic Research (EDR). Before joining EDR, I was a post-doc at University of California, Riverside (2020-2021), University of Arkansas, Fayetteville (2018-2020), and North Carolina A&T State University (2017). 


**My research interests** can be broken down into three main categories: **technology adoption**, **resource management policies**, and **interactions between hydro-biophysical and economic system**. I study these topics using theoretical, empirical, numerical, and bio-physical process-based modeling approaches. With the availability of large geo-referenced datasets, I increasingly spend time on machine learning and data analytics applications with reduced form econometric analysis. Being an engineer by training, I am involved in several interdisciplinary research projects. I collaborate extensively with soil and environmental scientists, civil engineers, hydrologists and economists.
