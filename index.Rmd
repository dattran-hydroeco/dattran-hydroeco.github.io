Hello, I am Dat. I currently work as a Research Scientist at the Florida Legislature, Office of Economic and Demographic Research (EDR), where I conduct policy-relevant analysis related to water resources, agriculture, and environmental sustainability. Prior to joining EDR, I held postdoctoral research appointments at the University of California, Riverside (2020–2021), the University of Arkansas, Fayetteville (2018–2020), and North Carolina A&T State University (2017).

I am an **interdisciplinary scholar** working at the interface of human and natural systems. My research focuses on understanding how human decision-making interacts with hydrologic and environmental processes, the modeling tools we use to study these coupled systems, and the policies designed to manage water resources sustainably, and the pedagogy of teaching it.

My **research interests** fall into three primary areas: **technology adoption, water resource management policies, and coupled hydro-biophysical and economic systems**. I investigate these topics using a combination of theoretical and empirical economic analysis, numerical optimization, and process-based hydrologic and biophysical modeling.

With the growing availability of large geo-referenced datasets, I increasingly apply machine learning and data analytics alongside process-based and statistical models to support **research on the Food–Water–Energy Nexus**.

I am **deeply committed to teaching and mentoring**. I enjoy working with students and view education as a core component of advancing environmental science and water resource management. My goal as an educator is to equip the next generation of environmental scientists and water resources professionals with strong quantitative skills, interdisciplinary perspectives, and the ability to connect physical processes with policy and decision-making.

Trained as an engineer, I am actively involved in interdisciplinary research and collaborate closely with hydrologists, soil and environmental scientists, civil engineers, and economists. I am **particularly interested in collaborative research that integrates hydrologic modeling with economic decision-making and policy analysis to address real-world water management challenges**.
