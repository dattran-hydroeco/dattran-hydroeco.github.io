# Florida's Water Use Projection (2023 Ed)
[Here is an interactive web-based showing Florida water use projection for 2020-2040](https://github.com/dattran-hydroeco/FL_WR_2023). The app was built using Shiny package. The projection comes from Florida Department of Environmental Protection (DEP). [More information on this projection can be found here](http://edr.state.fl.us/Content/natural-resources/2023_AnnualAssessmentWaterResources_Chapter3.pdf) or [contact me](https://dattran-hydroeco.github.io/index.html)

# Florida's Water Use Projection: A Machine Learning Approach
This approach integrates a K-Means Clustering and Multiple Linear Regression to forecast sectoral water use for Florida during 2020-2040.

<!-- ### R and R-Studio -->

<!-- #### [R](http://www.r-project.org) is a free open-source programming language that can be used for statistical analysis, data-simulation, graphing, and lots of other stuff. Another free program is [R-studio](http://www.rstudio.com), that provides a nice graphic interface for R. Download R first, then download R-studio. Both can run on PCs, Macs or Linux. Students will be learning R in the stats labs using the lab manual [](). -->
