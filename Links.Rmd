## Florida's Water Use Projection (2023 Ed)
<hr style="border:1px solid black"> <!-- add black line -->

[Here is a simple, pilot, interactive web-based showing Florida's water use projection for 2020-2040](https://dattran-hydroeco.shinyapps.io/FL_WR_2023/). The app was built using Shiny package in [R](https://www.r-project.org/about.html). The projection comes from the Florida Department of Environmental Protection (DEP). [More information on this projection can be found here](http://edr.state.fl.us/Content/natural-resources/2024_AnnualAssessmentWaterResources_Chapter3.pdf) or [please contact me](https://dattran-hydroeco.github.io/index.html)

## Florida's Water Use Projection: A Machine Learning Approach
<hr style="border:1px solid black"> <!-- add black line -->
This approach integrates a K-Means Clustering and Multiple Linear Regression to forecast sectoral water use for Florida during 2020-2040. [More information on this projection can be found here](http://edr.state.fl.us/Content/natural-resources/2024_AnnualAssessmentWaterResources_Chapter3.pdf) or [please contact me](https://dattran-hydroeco.github.io/index.html)

<!-- ### R and R-Studio -->

<!-- #### [R](http://www.r-project.org) is a free open-source programming language that can be used for statistical analysis, data-simulation, graphing, and lots of other stuff. Another free program is [R-studio](http://www.rstudio.com), that provides a nice graphic interface for R. Download R first, then download R-studio. Both can run on PCs, Macs or Linux. Students will be learning R in the stats labs using the lab manual [](). -->
